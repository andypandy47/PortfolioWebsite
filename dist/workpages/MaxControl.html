            Max Control was an event created by myself and four others that
            showcased a number of instruments and an LED based, reactive
            lighting system. Over the course of several months, each member of
            the group developed their own systems and together, we rehearsed a
            performance that would demonstrate how each of these could be
            utilised.

          <p>
            For my system, I created reactive LED lighting to give the event
            some interesting visual content. This was acheived by sending
            amplitude data from MaxMSP, through serial port connection into an
            Arduino. A program written for the Arduino then took the incoming
            data and used it as an indication of how many lights on each LED
            strip should be displayed.
